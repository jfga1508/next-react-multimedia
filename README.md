# NextJS/React- Multimedia Youtube App

This is an experimental app that uses NextJS, React Query, React Hook
Form, Axios and Vercel PostgreSQL where you can login/register and view a list of categories with youtube videos in it.
Keep in mind that there is no custom styling added to it besides Tailwind's default components, the tecnical assessment didn't require any styling or layout to be created.

## Todo

-   Video's description is something that still needs to be added.
-   Unit testing is something that still needs to be added.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Log in with the assigned credentials and done!
